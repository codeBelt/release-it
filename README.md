# Turborepo starter

[Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) is a high-performance system for monorepos, simplifies managing your codebase as you can have a single `lint`, `build`, `test`, and `release` process for all packages. [Learn more](https://vercel.com/blog/monorepos-are-changing-how-teams-build-software) about how monorepos improve your development workflow.

## What's inside?

This guide explains how to use a React design system starter powered by:

- üèé [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) ‚Äî High-performance build system for Monorepos
- üöÄ [React](https://reactjs.org/) ‚Äî JavaScript library for user interfaces

### Apps and Packages

- `web`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app

### Useful Commands

- `pnpm dev` - Previews all apps locally
- `pnpm lint` - Lint all apps and packages
- `pnpm build` - Build all packages
- `pnpm release` - Bumps version, updates changelog and releases
- `pnpm clean` - Clean up all `node_modules` and `dist` folders

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). See more on [CONTRIBUTING](/CONTRIBUTING.md) on developer tools.

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
